## Overview

The <a href="https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/" target="_blank">Ukraine Support Tracker</a> monitors and quantifies international support for Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022. This interactive dashboard visualizes comprehensive data on military, financial, and humanitarian aid commitments from partner countries worldwide. I wrote this dashboard to enable as frictionless access as possible, hopefully doing my part in the provision of this global commons. I hope it will enable more informed debates about this subject by giving the data and the team behind it their time to...shine.

## Key Features

All plots are interactable, enabling selection of certain parts and zooming. (De-)Selection of specfic data is enable by interactive elements of dashboard or directly within the plot by clicking on the legends. All plots can be downloaded in their currenct configuration.

While this dashboard is tries to enhance data presentation and interactability the secondary priority is communicating and presenting the work of the Ukraine Support Tracker as unaltered as possible. Where the authors added auxiliary or clarifying information, this is done here as well. Additionally, each individual plot denotes its data source within the original file to enable easy clarification if needed.
